# High-fidelity lab: precise measurements, minimal noise, no latency
id: high_fidelity_lab
name: High-Fidelity Lab
description: >
  Simulates a controlled lab environment with precise sensing, minimal noise,
  and calibrated physics. Serves as the "design model" (M_A) for pseudo-reality
  experiments: control software designed here should be tested on noisier profiles.
